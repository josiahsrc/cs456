/// Ideas:
/// - A play button that repels away from your finger like a magnet. 
/// You have to use two  fingers. One to move it, the other to press 
/// it.
/// - When you press on the play button, a radial menu appears with 
/// 10 items. Each one is not related to the play button.
/// - Put the play button below the video. Or way apart from the 
/// video.
/// - You need to repel the play button into the view so you can use
/// it. There's only one play button. You have to move it in between
/// video frames to use it for each video frame.

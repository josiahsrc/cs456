# 6 principles of conversation

- Context
    - Of participants (based on awareness)
        - Prof doesn't have context of what students are seeing on zoom.
    - Face to face
        - You have maximum context. You can see each other, you know what they're saying, where they are.
        - You might not know mental state, but you can see that they're angry.
    - Zoom
        - Limited by what you can see/hear/smell screen.
        - Side effects of zoom context. It's limited and unlimited in other ways. Having a conversation in someone else's appartment is weird.
- Initiation ritual
    - Words, actions, sounds that initiate a conversation.
    - Face to face
        - Physical
        - "Hey how are you?"
        - Expecting you to say "fine", not give a life story.
    - Zoom
        - Professor will say hi to us. The students wouldn't normally respond, unless it was one on one.
        - Camera on for small meetings, not for large class.
- Turn taking
    - Who talks when.
    - More generally, who communicates.
    - Face to face
        - Verbal/non-verbal
        - Pauses to let other person go
    - Zoom
        - When two people talk, one person will say "you go ahead"
        - Awkardness, not really any way to know turn taking.
        - Professor might say, all students try answer.
- Farewell rituals
    - Words, actions, sounds that end a conversation.
    - Face to face
        - Skip
        - See ya
        - Pause in convo
        - Bell rings
    - Zoom
        - Just close meeting
        - Explicitley saying that "that's it for today, I'll stick around for any questions."
- Cues
    - Verbal and non-verbal indicators.
    - Face to face
        - Silence
        - Someone finishes idea
        - Someone asks you a question
    - Zoom
        - Mic icon on/off
        - Clap button
        - Camera on gives context
- Break down
    - What happens when something goes wrong.
    - Face to face
        - Someone doesn't get the reference to what someone else is referencing.
        - Rich vocabulary of verbal on non-verbal things you can do when there's a break down.
